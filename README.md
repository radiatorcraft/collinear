This script automates following users on the Scratch platform.

## Features:

* Follows users from a text file containing usernames.
* Allows setting a delay between follow attempts.
* Logs progress and estimated remaining time.
* Provides optional user input for settings or loading from a JSON file.
* Includes a benchmark functionality to estimate processing time (this is mostly for developer debugging).

* Python 3
* `scratchapi` library (install with `pip install scratchapi`)
